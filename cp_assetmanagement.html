    <title>AssetManagement: manage your properties with RavenDB + WebAPI and KnockoutJS and more</title></head>
	<body>
	<p>While learning a new technology or framework, I always like to build small but well covering Proof Of Concept application. It is even better if one can combine several new technologies into such a project. This is description of one such project which uses RavenDB, WebAPI, KnockoutJS, Bootstrap, D3JS.</p>
	<p><b><a href="https://github.com/hoonzis/CPKnockoutRavenDB">Source code is available on GitHub</a></b></p>
	<h2>The Use Case</h2>
	<p>Everyone renting an appartment or any other property knows that it might be quite difficult to track the depenses and income in order to assure himself of the rentability of the given property. I have created an applications which helps with just that and thanks to this applications I was able the mentioned technologies. Now let's take a look at them closer.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b><a href="http://ravendb.net/">RavenDB</a></b> - to stored the data. RavenDB is a document database, which seamlessly integrates into any C# project.</li>
		<li><b><a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">WebAPI</a></b> - to serve the data through REST services. WebAPI is a quite new technology from MS which is ment to provide better support for building REST services. Ofcourse we have built REST services with WCF before, so the questions is why should we change to WebAPI? WCF was created in the age of WSDL. It was adapted later to generate JSON, however inside it still uses XML as data transformation format. WebAPI is complete rewrite which also provides other interesting features.</li>
		<li><b><a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a></b> - to glue the interaction on the client side. Knockout is one of the cool JavaScript MV(*) frameworks which provide a way to organise and facilitate the JavaScript developement. Unlike other frameworks (Backbone or Ember) KnockoutJS concentrate itself on binding of the data and actions between the GUI (HTML) and the ViewModel (JavaScript).</li>
		<li><b><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a></b> - to give it a decent GUI. As its name says, bootstrap enables a quick developement of a web application's GUI. It is a greate tool to all of us who just want to get the project out and we still need a decent user interface.</li>
		<li><b><a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a></b> - to visualize data using charts. D3JS is a JavaScript libraty enabling the user to manipulate the DOM.</li>
		<li><b><a href="https://github.com/hoonzis/KoExtensions">KoExtensions</a></b> - very set of tools which I have created, allowing easy creation of pie charts or binding to google maps while using KnockoutJS.
	</ul>
	<p>Here is how it looks like at the end:</p>
	<img style="width:600px" src="https://raw.github.com/hoonzis/CPKnockoutRavenDB/master/img/all.PNG"/>
	<h2>The architecture of the application</h2>
	<p>The architecture is visualized in the following diagram. The backend is composed of MVC application, which exposes several API controllers. These controllers talk directly to the database throught RavenDB IDocumentSession interface. The REST services are invoked by ViewModel code written in JavaScript. The content of the ViewModels is bound the view using Knockout.</p>
	<img style="width:500px" src="https://raw.github.com/hoonzis/CPKnockoutRavenDB/master/img/architecture.png"/>
	<p>This application is as lightweight as possible. It is composed of a MVC 4 application with two types of Controllers: Standard and API. Standard controllers are the ones which are used to render the base web pages. Event though that this applications uses client side MVVM, it has to be hosted. I have chosed to host the applications inside the classic ASP.MVC application. It is not a sin to mix server and client side MVC in one application.</p>
	
	<p>This application has no service layer. All the logic can be found inside the Controllers. The controllers all use directly the <b>IDocumentSession</b> of RavenDB to access the database. The good approach to user RavenDB when using ASP.MVC is described on the official web page. Basically the RavenDB session is openned when the controllers action is started and is closed when the action terminates. The structure of API controller however differs a little bit, but the principle is the same.</p>
	
	<h2>When to use Knockout</h2>
	<p>There are probably a lot of people around there with exactly the same question. It basically comes to the answer of whether to use or not any client side MVC JavaScript framework. From my purely personal point of view this makes sence when one or more of these conditions are met:
	<ul><li>You have a good server side REST API (or you plan to build one) and wan't to use it to build a web page.</li>
	<li>You are building more an web-application then a website. That is to say, your users will stay at the page for some time, perform multiple actions, keep some user state and you need a responsive application for that.</li>
	<li>You need a really dynamic page. Even if you would use server side MVC than you would somehow need to include a lot of JavaScript for the dynamics of the page.</li></ul>
	<p>This is just my personal opinion and there is a lot of discussion around internet and as usually no silver-bullet answer.</p>
	</body>
	<h2>Data model</h2>
	<p>RavenDB is NoSQL database, or as it would be better to say non-relational database. The data is stored in document collections, serialized to JSON. Each document contains an object or more specifically graph of objects serialized to JSON. When working with relational databases, the aggregated graph of objects which is served to the user is usually constructed by several joins into several tables. When working with document databases, the data which is aggregated into one object graph, should be also stored that way. In our particular example, on property or asset can have several rents and several charges. One rent does not really have sense without the asset to which it is attached. This applications is composed of two collections: Owners and Assets. Here are examples of Owner and Asset document.</p>
	<pre>
	{
	  "Name": null,
	  "UserName": "test",	  
	  "Password": "test"
	}
	</pre>
	<pre>
	{
	  "OwnerId": 1,
	  "LastChargeId": 5,
	  "LastRentId": 0,
	  "Name": "Appartment #1",
	  "Address": "5th Ave",
	  "City": "New York",
	  "Country": "USA",
	  "ZipCode": "10021",
	  "Latitude": 40.774,
	  "Longitude": -73.965,
	  "InitialCosts": 0.0,
	  "Rents": [],
	  "Charges": [
		{
		  "Counterparty": "New York Electrics",
		  "Type": null,
		  "Automatic": false,
		  "Regularity": "MONTH",
		  "Id": 2,
		  "Name": "Electricity",
		  "PaymentDay": 4,
		  "AccountNumber": "9084938890-2491",
		  "Amount": 1000.0,
		  "Unit": 3,
		  "Notes": "",
		  "End": "2013-03-19T23:00:00.0000000Z",
		  "Start": "2013-03-10T23:00:00.0000000Z",
		},
		{ ... },
		{ ... }
	  ],
	  "Ebit": 0.0,
	  "Size": 80.0,
	  "PMS": 1250000.0,
	  "Price": 100000000.0,
	  "IncomeTax": 0.0,
	  "InterestRate": 0.0
	}
	</pre>
	<p>One question you might be asking yourself is why did I not use only one collection of Owners. Each <i>Owner</i> document would than contain all the assets as an inner collection. This is just because, I thought it might make sense in the future, two have an asset shared by two owners. The current design allows us anyway in the future, connect the asset to an collection of Owners, simply by replacing <i>OwnerID</i> property with and collection of integers, containing all the ids of the owners.</p>
	<h2>The Backend</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>GET api/assets</b> - get the list of all the appartment of current user</li>
		<li><b>PUT api/charges?assetID={id}</b> - add new charge to existing asset</li>
		<li><b>POST api/charges?assetID={id}</b> - update existing charge in given asset</li>
		<li><b>PUT api/rents/</b> - add new charge</li>
		<li><b>POST api/rents</b> - update existing charge</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Getting all the assets</h3>
	<p>Without further information let's take a look at the first Controller which returns all the "properties" of the logged owner. This service is available at <i>api/assets</i>.</p>
	<pre>
		[Authorize]
        public IEnumerable&lt;Object&gt; Get()
        {
            var owner = ObtainCurrentOwner();
            var assets = GetAssets(owner.Id);
            return result;
        }
		
		protected Owner ObtainCurrentOwner()
        {
            return RavenSession.Query&lt;Owner&gt;().SingleOrDefault(x =&gt; x.UserName == HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Name);
        }
		
		public IEnumerable&lt;Asset&gt; GetAssets(int ownerID)
        {
            return RavenSession.Query&lt;Asset&gt;().Where(x =&gt; x.OwnerId == ownerID);
        }
	</pre>
	<p>This method is decorated with the <b>[Authorize]</b> attribute. This mechanism was known previosly in WCF. ASP.NET checks for the cookie within this request and if no cookie is present the request is rejected. Getting the current user and all it's assets is a metter of two linq queries using the <b>RavenSession.</b> which has to be opened before.</p>
	<h3>Opening RavenDB session</h3>
	<p>All the controllers inherit from a base controller called <i>RavenApiController</i>. This controller opens the session to RavenDB when it is initialized and than potentially saves the changes to the database when the work is finished. The <i>dispose</i> method of the controller is the last method which is invoked when the work is over.</p>
	<pre>
	protected override void Initialize(System.Web.Http.Controllers.HttpControllerContext controllerContext)
	{
		base.Initialize(controllerContext);
		if(RavenSession == null)
			RavenSession = WebApiApplication.Store.OpenSession();
	}
	
	protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)
	{
		base.Dispose(disposing);
		using (RavenSession)
		{
			if (RavenSession != null)
				RavenSession.SaveChanges();
		}
	}
	</pre>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Adding new Charge</h3>
	<p>This controller has two parametes. The charge object which is passed in as JSON object and the <i>assetID</i> which is specified as URL parameter. Since RavenDB provides changes tracking, there is no need to perform additional work. RavenDB will notice, that new charge was added to the <i>Charges</i> collection and when <i>SaveChanges</i> function is invoked on the Raven session, the new charge will be persisted to the database. As it has been explained before, the <i>SaveChanges</i> is invoked while disposing the controller.</p>
	<pre>
		public Object Post(Charge value, int assetID)
		{
			var owner = ObtainCurrentOwner();
			var asset = GetAsset(assetID,owner);
			value.Id = asset.GenerateChargeId();
			
			if (asset.Charges == null)
			{
				asset.Charges = new List&lt;Charge&gt;();
			}

			asset.Charges.Add(value);
			return GetResponse(value, asset, true);
		}
	</pre>
	<p>Note that if you want to acceess the <i>Charge</i> object in the future, you need to give it and ID. RavenDB does generated ID's only for documents, but not for any inner objects. The solution here is to give each Asset and id counter for the charges.
	<h2>The FrontEnd</h2>
	<p>All the logic on the client side resides in ViewModel classes. I assume you are familiar with MVVM pattern. If not you can still continue reading, while the understanding should be intuitive if you have worked with MVC frameworks before. The parent ViewModel and the one which aggregates others is the <b>OwnerViewModel</b>. The ViewModels build a hierarchy similary as the domain objects.</p>
	<p>The OwnerViewModel has to get all the assets and build an <b>AssetViewModel</b> arround each recieved Asset. The data is retrived from the server as JSON using asynchronous request.</p>
	<pre>
	function OwnerViewModel() {
		var self = this;
		$.extend(self, new BaseViewModel());
		self.assets = ko.observableArray([]);
		self.selectedAsset = ko.observable([]);
		self.isBusy(true);
		self.message('Loading');

		$.ajax("/../api/assets", {
			type: "get", contentType: "application/json",
			statusCode: {
				401: function () { window.location = "/en/Account/LogOn" }
			},
			success: function (data) {
				var mappedAssets = $.map(data, function (item) {
					return new AssetViewModel(self, item);
				});
				self.assets(mappedAssets);
			}
		});
	</pre>
	<p>You can notice that this ViewModel calls jQuery's <b>$.extend</b> method right at the begining of the function. This is one of the ways to express inheritance in JavaScript. JavaScript is prototype based language. The objects derive directly from other objects, not from classes. The extend method basically copies all properties from the object specified in the parameter. All of my <i>ViewModels</i> have certain common properties such as <i>busy</i> or <i>message</i>. These are some help variables which I use on all ViewModels to visualize progress or show some info messages. Notice also the <i>selectedAsset</i> property, which holds the currently selected AsseetViewModel (imagine user selecting one line in the table of assets).</p>
	<p>Wihtout further examination let's take a look at the <b>AssetViewModel</b>. There are several self-epxlanatory properties such as <i>address</i>, <i>price</i> and similar. What is more interesting are the arrays of <i>Rents</i> and <i>Charges</i>. These are observable arrays of ViewModels which are filled during the construction of the AssetViewModel object. The data to this object is passed from the <i>OwnerViewModel</i>. The asset also holds its value to the owner in the <i>parent</i> property.</p>
	<pre>
	
	</pre>
	<p>Before detailing the last missing ViewModels (Rents and Charges), let's take a look at the first part of the View. The parent layout is defined in <i>_Layout.cshtml</i> however the part mastered by Knockout is defined in the <i>Index.cshtml</i> file. The left side menu is composed of two smaller menus. One which contains the list of properties with the possibility to create new one and another one which allows to switch over details of the selected property. Here is the View representing the first menu:</p>
	<img src="https://raw.github.com/hoonzis/CPKnockoutRavenDB/master/img/left_panel.PNG"/>
	
	<pre>
		&lt;div class="well sidebar-nav"&gt;
            &lt;li class="nav-header"&gt;Property list:&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;ul class="nav nav-list" data-bind="foreach:assets"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-bind="text:name,click:select" href="#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;ul class="nav nav-list"&gt;
                &lt;li class="nav-header"&gt;Actions:&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#" data-bind="click: newAsset"&gt;&lt;i class="icon-pencil"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;@BasicResources.NewProperty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
	</pre>
	<p><b>Foreach binding</b> was used in order to render all the appartments. For each appartment an anchor tag is emitted. The text of this tag is bound to the name of the appartment and the click actions is bound to the <i>select</i> function. The creation of new asset is handled by the <i>newAsset</i> function of the <i>OwnerViewModel</i>.</p>
	<p>The second part of the menu is defined directly as html. Three anchor tags are render, each of them pointing to different tab, using the same url pattern. For example the URL "#/{property-name}/overview" should show the "Overview" tab of the property with given name. Client side routing is used, in order to execute certain actions depending on the accessed url. In order to enable client side rendering <b>Path.JS</b> library is used. The <b>attribute binding of knockout</b> is used to render the correct anchor tag.</p>
	<pre>
		&lt;div class="well sidebar-nav" data-bind="with:selectedAsset"&gt;
			&lt;ul class="nav nav-list"&gt;
				&lt;li class="nav-header" data-bind="text:name"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-bind="attr: {href: '#/' + name() + '/overview'}"&gt;&lt;i class="icon-pencil"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-bind="attr: {href: '#/' + name() + '/charges'}"&gt;&lt;i class="icon-arrow-down"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Charges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-bind="attr: {href: '#/' + name() + '/rents'}"&gt;&lt;i class="icon-arrow-up"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Rents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	</pre>
	<p>You can also notice, that the <b>with binding</b> was used to set the current asset view model as the parent for the navigation div.</p>
	<p>The right part simply contains all of the 3 tabs (overview, charges or rents), only one of them visible at time. In order to separate the content into multiple files, partial rendering of ASP.MVC is used.<p>
	<pre>
		&lt;div id="assetDetail" class="span9" data-bind="template: {data: selectedAsset, if:selectedAsset, afterRender: detailsRendered}"&gt;
			&lt;div id="overview"&gt;
				@Html.Partial("Overview")
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;div id="charges"&gt;
				@Html.Partial("Charges")
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;div id="rents"&gt;
				@Html.Partial("Rents")
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	</pre>
	<p>Again the <b>with binding</b> is used as the selected appartment's ViewModel is used to back-up this part of the view.</p>
	<p>Now let's go back to the ViewModels. <b>ChargeViewModel</b> and <b>RentViewModel</b> have a same ancestor which is called <b>ObligationViewModel</b>. Since both rents and charges how some common properties such as the amount or the regularity, a common parent ViewModel is good place to define them.</p>
	<p>The most interesting part of <i>ChargeViewModel</i> is the <i>save</i> function which uses JQuery to emit a HTTP request to the <i>ChargesController</i>. As previously described, two different operations are exposed with the same url, one for creation (HTTP PUT) another for update (HTTP POST). The ViewModel uses a <i>new</i> flag to distinguish these two cases. Before the request is executed, the ViewModel uses <a href="https://github.com/ericmbarnard/Knockout-Validation">Knockout.Validation</a> plugin to perform this check with the<i>errors</i> property.</p>
	<pre>
	self.save = function () {
        if (self.errors().length != 0) {
            self.errors().showAllMessages();
            return;
        }

        self.isBusy(true);
        data = self.toDto();
        var rUrl = "/../api/charges?assetID=" + self.parent.id();
        if (self.isNew())
            var opType = "post";
        else
            var opType = "put";

        $.ajax(rUrl, {
            data: JSON.stringify(data),
            type: opType, contentType: "application/json",
            success: function (result) {
                self.isBusy(false);
                self.message(result.message);
                if (self.isNew()) {
                    self.update(result.dto);
                    parent.charges.push(self);
                }
            }
        });
    }
	</pre>
	<p>When there are no validation errors, the object which will be send to the server is created from the ViewModel by the <i>toDto</i> method. It does not make sense to serialize the whole ViewModel and send it to the server. In the <i>toDto</i> method the ViewModel is converted to an JS object which can be directly mapped to the server side entity. The <i>ajax</i> method of jQuery is called, which creates new HTTP request. When the response from the server comes back, the callback is executed, which performs several operations. Besides updating the GUI-helpful variables the callback performs two different operations. If the new charge was added, then it has to be added also to the parent ViewModel(appartment - represented by <i>AssetViewModel</i>). The new charge also recieved the server side ID which has to be updated. All other properties are already up-to-date.
	</p>
	<h3>Removing charge</h3>
	<p>The removing operations is very simple. Only asset and charge ids have to be supplied to the controller. If the operations has succeed, then againg the collection of charges  inside <i>AssetViewModel</i> has to be updated.</p>
	<pre>
	self.remove = function () {
        $.ajax("/../api/charges/" + self.id() + "?assetID=" + self.parent.id(), {
            type: "delete", contentType: "application/json",
            success: function (result) {
                self.isBusy(false);
                parent.charges.remove(self);
                parent.selectedCharge(null);
            }
        });
    };
	</pre>
	<h3>Charges View</h3>
	<p>The charges view is quite classical master detail view. A table of charges is rendered using the foreach binding and then the currently selected charge is rendered in a side div tag using the with binding.</p>
	<pre>
	 &lt;div class="row-fluid"&gt;
		&lt;table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"&gt;
			&lt;tbody data-bind="foreach: charges"&gt;
				&lt;tr style="cursor: pointer;" data-bind="click: select"&gt;
					&lt;td style="vertical-align: middle"&gt;
						&lt;div data-bind='text: name'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
					&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;td style="vertical-align: middle"&gt;
						&lt;div data-bind="text: amount"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
					&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;td style="vertical-align: middle"&gt;
						&lt;div data-bind="text: amount"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
					&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;td&gt;
						&lt;button type="submit" class="btn" data-bind="visibility: !isNew(), click:remove"&gt;&lt;i class="icon-trash"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
					&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;/tbody&gt;
		&lt;/table&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	</pre>
	<p>You can see, that the click action of the table row is bound the the <i>select</i> method of the <i>ChargeViewModel</i></p>
	<h3>Using the KoExtensions</h3>
	<p>As you can see there is a pie chart representing the charges repartition. This chart is rendered using D3JS, more specifically by a special binding of a small project of mine called KoExtensions. The rendering of the graph is really simple. The only thing to do is to use the <i>piechart</i> binding which is part of KoExtensions. This binding takes 3 parameters: the collection of the data to be rendered, transformation function to indicate which values inside the collection should be used to render the graph and the last but not least the initialization parameters.</p>
	<img src="https://raw.github.com/hoonzis/CPKnockoutRavenDB/master/img/pie_chart.PNG"/>
	<pre>
	&lt;div data-bind="piechart: charges, transformation:obligationToChart"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	function obligationToChart(d) {
		return { x: d.name(), y: d.amount() };
	}
	</pre>
	<p>In order to render the graph, the KoExtensions binding needs to know which value in one concretion collection item specifies the with of each arc in the pie chart and which value is the title. Internally these values are simply <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. The transformation function uses the <i>name</i> and the <i>amount</i> values of the charge. The initialization parameters of the chart are not set, so the default once are used.</p>
	<h3>Bootstrap style date-time picker</h3>
	<p>Bootstrap does not contain a date-time picker nor is it on their roadmap. Luckily the community came up with a solution. I have used the one called <a href="http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/">bootstrap-datepicker.js</a>. Since I needed to use it with Knockout, I have came up with another special binding which you can find in KoExtensions, it's usage is fairly simple.</p>
	<pre>
	&lt;div class="controls"&gt;
		&lt;input type="text" data-bind="datepicker:end"&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	</pre>
	<img src="https://raw.github.com/hoonzis/CPKnockoutRavenDB/master/img/datepicker.PNG"/>
	<h3>Binding to the map</h3>
	<p>The last usage of KoExtensions is the rendering of the map containing all the assets in the left hand bar. I have created a binding which enables the rendering of one or more ViewModels on the map, by specifing which property contains the latitude and longitude values. Here the binding is used withing an foreach binding, in order to display all the appartments in the map.</i>
	<pre>
	&lt;div class="row-fluid"&gt;
		&lt;div data-bind="foreach: assets"&gt;
			&lt;div data-bind="latitude: lat, longitude:lng, map:map, selected:selected"&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;div id="map" style="width: 100%; height: 300px"&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	</pre>
	<p>The map has to be initialized the usual way as described in the official google maps tutorial, the binding does not take care of this. This enables the developer to define the map exactly the way he likes. Any other elements can be rendered on the same map, simply by passing the same map object to other bindings. The selected property which is passed in the binding tells the binding which variable it should update or which function to call when one element is selected in the map.</p>
	<h3>Knockout Validation and Bootstrap styles</h3>
	<p>One of the Knockout's feature which make it a really great tool, is the styles binding, providing you with the ability to associate one concrete css style to an UI component, if some condition in the ViewModel was met. One of the typical examples is giving the selected row in a table a highlight.</p>
	<pre>
	&lt;tr style="cursor: pointer;" data-bind="css : {info:selected},click: select"&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt;

	<p>Bootstrap provides styles for highlighting UI components. <a href="">Knockout-Validation</a> is a great plugin which extends any observable value with <i>isValid</i> property, and enables the developer to define rules which will determine the value of this property.</p>
	<pre>
	self.amount = ko.observable().extend({ required: true, number: true });
	self.name = ko.observable().extend({ required: true });
	
	&lt;div class="control-group" data-bind="css : {error:!name.isValid()}"&gt;
		&lt;label class="control-label"&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
		&lt;div class="controls"&gt;
			&lt;input type="text" placeholder="@BasicResources.Name" data-bind="value:name"&gt;
			&lt;span class="help-inline" data-bind="validationMessage: name"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class="control-group" data-bind="css : {error:!amount.isValid()}"&gt;
		&lt;label class="control-label"&gt;@BasicResources.Amount&lt;/label&gt;
		&lt;div class="controls"&gt;
			&lt;input type="text" placeholder="@BasicResources.Amount" data-bind="value: amount"&gt;
			&lt;span class="help-inline" data-bind="validationMessage: amount"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	</pre>

	<p>By combining these Bootstrap with Knockout-Validation, we can achieve a very nice effect of highlighting when the value is invalid</p>
	<h2>What is not described in this article</h2>
	<p>I did not describe every line of code, but since the project is available at my Github account, you can easily examine it. There are interesting parts at which you might take a look at: JavaScript unit tests, integration test for WebAPI Controller, bundles to regroup  and minimize several JS files. Also please not, that the code is not perfect I have used it to play around, not to create a production ready application.</p>
	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>That's about all. I think that the frameworks which I have used are all great at what they do. RavenDB in a .NET project is extremely not-present. You don't even have to think about your data storage layer. I know that this DB has much more to offer, but I did not dig to it enough to be able to talk about performance or optimization it provides, but I will definitely check it out later. KnockoutJS is great at UI data binding. It does not pretend to do more but it does that perfectly. There is not a better tool to declaratively define UI and comportement. D3.js even though I did not use it a lot is very powerfull. Can visualize any data any way you want. The only minus might be it's size. And bootstrap is finally a tool which enables us to get out <i>usable</i> UI in <i>reasonable</i> time, without having a designer at our side. This was not really possible before.</p>
