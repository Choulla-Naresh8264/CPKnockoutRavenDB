    <title>AssetManagement: manage your properties with RavenDB + WebAPI and KnockoutJS and more</title></head>
	<body>
	<p>Everyone ranting an appartment are any other property knows that it might be quite difficult to track the depenses and income in order to assure himself of the rentability of the given property. I have created an applications which helps with just that and thanks to this applications I was able to play with the following technologies:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>RavenDB - to stored the data. RavenDB is a document database, which seamlessly integrates into any C# project.</li>
		<li>WebAPI - to serve the data through REST services. WebAPI is a quite new technology from MS which is ment to provide better support for building REST services. Ofcourse we have build REST services with WCF before, so the questions is why should we change to WebAPI? WCF was created in the age of WSDL. It was adapted later to generate JSON, however inside it still uses XML as data transformation format. WebAPI is complete rewrite which also provides other interesting features.</li>
		<li>KnockoutJS - to glue the interaction on the client side. Knockout is one of the cool JavaScript MV* frameworks which provide a way to organise and facilitate the JavaScript developement. Unlike other frameworks (Backbone or Ember) KnockoutJS concentrate itself on binding of the data and actions between the GUI (HTML) and the ViewModel (JavaScript).</li>
		<li>Bootstrap - to give it a decent GUI. As its name says, bootstrap enables a quick developement of a web application's GUI. It is a greate tool to all of us who just want to get the project out and we still need a decent user interface.</li>
		<li>D3JS - to visualize data using charts. D3JS is a JavaScript libraty enabling the user to manipulate the DOM.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>The architecture of the application</h2>
	<p>The architecture is visualized in the following diagram. The backend is composed of MVC application, which exposes several API controllers. These controllers talk directly to the database throught RavenDB IDocumentSession interface. The REST services are invoked by ViewModel code written in JavaScript. The content of the ViewModels is bound the view using Knockout.</p>
	
	<p>This application is as lightweight as possible. It is composed of a MVC 4 application with two types of Controllers: Standard and API. Standard controllers are the ones which are used to render the base web pages. Event though that this applications uses client side MVVM, it has to be hosted. I have chosed to host the applications inside the classic ASP.MVC application. It is not a sin to mix server and client side MVC in one application.</p>
	
	<p>This application has no service layer. All the logic can be found inside the Controllers. The controllers all use directly the <b>IDocumentSession</b> of RavenDB to access the database. The good approach to user RavenDB when using ASP.MVC is described on the official web page. Basically the RavenDB session is openned when the controllers action is started and is closed when the action terminates. The structure of API controller however differs a little bit, but the principle is the same.</p>
	
	<h3>When to use Knockout</h3>
	<p>There are probably a lot of people around there with exactly the same question. It basically comes to the answer of whether to use or not any client side MVC JavaScript framework. From my purely personal point of view this makes sence when one or more of these conditions are filled:
	<ul><li>You have a good server side REST API (or you plan to build one) and wan't to use it to build a web page.</li>
	<li>You are building more an web-application then a website. That is to say, your users will stay at the page for some time, perform multiple actions and you need a responsive application for that.</li>
	<li>You need a really dynamic page. Even if you would use server side MVC than you would somehow need to include a lot of JavaScript for the dynamics of the page.</li></ul>
	</body>
	<h2>Data model</h2>
	<p>RavenDB is NoSQL database, or as it would be better to say non-relational database. The data is stored in document collections, serialized to JSON. Each document contains an object or more specifically graph of objects serialized to JSON. When working with relational databases, the aggregated graph of objects which is served to the user is usually constructed by several joins into several tables. When working with document databases, the data which is aggregated into one object graph, should be also stored that way. In our particular example, on property or asset can have several rents and several charges. One rent does not really have sense without the asset to which it is attached. This applications is composed of two collections: Owners and Assets. Here are examples of Owner and Asset document.</p>
	<pre>
	</pre>
	<p>One question you might be asking yourself is why did I not use only one collection of Owners. Each <i>Owner</i> document would than contain all the assets as an inner collection. This is just because, I thought it might make sense in the future, two have an asset shared by two owners. The current design allows us anyway in the future, connect the asset to an collection of Owners, simply by replacing <i>OwnerID</i> property with and collection of integers, containing all the ids of the owners.</p>
	<h2>The Backend</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>GET api/assets</b> - get the list of all the appartment of current user</li>
		<li><b>PUT api/charges?assetID={id}</b> - add new charge to existing asset</li>
		<li><b>POST api/charges?assetID={id}</b> - update existing charge in given asset</li>
		<li><b>PUT api/rents/</b> - add new charge</li>
		<li><b>POST api/rents</b> - update existing charge</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Getting all the assets</h3>
	<p>Without further information let's take a look at the first Controller which returns all the "properties" of the logged owner. This service is available at <i>api/assets</i>.</p>
	<pre>
		[Authorize]
        public IEnumerable<Object> Get()
        {
            var owner = ObtainCurrentOwner();
            var assets = GetAssets(owner.Id);
            return result;
        }
		
		protected Owner ObtainCurrentOwner()
        {
            return RavenSession.Query<Owner>().SingleOrDefault(x => x.UserName == HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Name);
        }
		
		public IEnumerable<Asset> GetAssets(int ownerID)
        {
            return RavenSession.Query<Asset>().Where(x => x.OwnerId == ownerID);
        }
	</pre>
	<p>This method is decorated with the <b>[Authorize]</b> attribute. This mechanism was known previosly in WCF. ASP.NET checks for the cookie within this request and if no cookie is present the request is rejected. Getting the current user and all it's assets is a metter of two linq queries using the <b>RavenSession.</b> which has to be opened before.</p>
	<h3>Opening RavenDB session</h3>
	<p>All the controllers inherit from a base controller called <i>RavenApiController</i>. This controller opens the session to RavenDB when it is initialized and than potentially saves the changes to the database when the work is finished. The <i>dispose</i> method of the controller is the last method which is invoked when the work is over.</p>
	<pre>
	protected override void Initialize(System.Web.Http.Controllers.HttpControllerContext controllerContext)
	{
		base.Initialize(controllerContext);
		if(RavenSession == null)
			RavenSession = WebApiApplication.Store.OpenSession();
	}
	
	protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)
	{
		base.Dispose(disposing);
		using (RavenSession)
		{
			if (RavenSession != null)
				RavenSession.SaveChanges();
		}
	}
	</pre>
	<p></p>
	<h3>Adding new Charge</h3>
	<p>This controller has two parametes. The charge object which is passed in as JSON object and the <i>assetID</i> which is specified as URL parameter. Since RavenDB provides changes tracking, there is no need to perform additional work. RavenDB will notice, that new charge was added to the <i>Charges</i> collection and when <i>SaveChanges</i> function is invoked on the Raven session, the new charge will be persisted to the database. As it has been explained before, the <i>SaveChanges</i> is invoked while disposing the controller.</p>
	<pre>
		public Object Post(Charge value, int assetID)
		{
			var owner = ObtainCurrentOwner();
			var asset = GetAsset(assetID,owner);
			value.Id = asset.GenerateChargeId();
			
			if (asset.Charges == null)
			{
				asset.Charges = new List&lt;Charge&gt;();
			}

			asset.Charges.Add(value);
			return GetResponse(value, asset, true);
		}
	</pre>
	<p>Note that if you want to acceess the <i>Charge</i> object in the future, you need to give it and ID. RavenDB does generated ID's only for documents, but not for any inner objects. The solution here is to give each Asset and id counter for the charges.
	<h2>The FrontEnd</h2>
	<p>All the logic on the client side resides in ViewModel classes. I assume you are familiar with MVVM pattern. If not you can still continue reading, while the understanding should be intuitive if you have worked with MVC frameworks before. The parent ViewModel and the one which aggregates others is the <b>OwnerViewModel</b>. The ViewModels build a hierarchy similary as the domain objects.</p>
	<p>The OwnerViewModel has to get all the assets and build an <b>AssetViewModel</b> arround each recieved Asset. The data is retrived from the server as JSON using asynchronous request.</p>
	<pre>
	function OwnerViewModel() {
		var self = this;
		$.extend(self, new BaseViewModel());
		self.assets = ko.observableArray([]);
		self.selectedAsset = ko.observable([]);
		self.isBusy(true);
		self.message('Loading');

		$.ajax("/../api/assets", {
			type: "get", contentType: "application/json",
			statusCode: {
				401: function () { window.location = "/en/Account/LogOn" }
			},
			success: function (data) {
				var mappedAssets = $.map(data, function (item) {
					return new AssetViewModel(self, item);
				});
				self.assets(mappedAssets);
			}
		});
	</pre>
	<p>You can notice that this ViewModel calls jQuery's <b>$.extend</b> method right at the begining of the function. This is one of the ways to express inheritance in JavaScript. JavaScript is prototype based language. The objects derive directly from other objects, not from classes. The extend method basically copies all properties from the object specified in the parameter. All of my <i>ViewModels</i> have certain common properties such as <i>busy</i> or <i>message</i>. These are some help variables which I use on all ViewModels to visualize progress or show some info messages. Notice also the <i>selectedAsset</i> property, which holds the currently selected AsseetViewModel (imagine user selecting one line in the table of assets).</p>
	<p>Wihtout further examination let's take a look at the <b>AssetViewModel</b>. There are several self-epxlanatory properties such as <i>address</i>, <i>price</i> and similar. What is more interesting are the arrays of <i>Rents</i> and <i>Charges</i>. These are observable arrays of ViewModels which are filled during the construction of the AssetViewModel object. The data to this object is passed from the <i>OwnerViewModel</i>. The asset also holds its value to the owner in the <i>parent</i> property.</p>
	<pre>
	
	</pre>
	<p>Before detailing the last missing ViewModels (Rents and Charges), let's take a look at the first part of the View. The parent layout is defined in <i>_Layout.cshtml<i> however the part mastered by Knockout is defined in the <i>Index.cshtml</i> file. The left side menu is composed of two smaller menus. One which contains the list of properties with the possibility to create new one and another one which allows to switch over details of the selected property. Here is the View representing the first menu:</p>
	<pre>
		<div class="well sidebar-nav">
            <li class="nav-header">Property list:</li>
            <ul class="nav nav-list" data-bind="foreach:assets">
                <li><a data-bind="text:name,click:select" href="#"></a></li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="nav nav-list">
                <li class="nav-header">Actions:</li>
                <li><a href="#" data-bind="click: newAsset"><i class="icon-pencil"></i>@BasicResources.NewProperty</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
	</pre>
	<p><b>Foreach binding</b> was used in order to render all the appartments. For each appartment an anchor tag is emitted. The text of this tag is bound to the name of the appartment and the click actions is bound to the <i>select</i> function. The creation of new asset is handled by the <i>newAsset</i> function of the <i>OwnerViewModel</i>.</p>
	<p>The second part of the menu is defined directly as html. Three anchor tags are render, each of them pointing to different tab, using the same url pattern. For example the URL "#/{property-name}/overview" should show the "Overview" tab of the property with given name. Client side routing is used, in order to execute certain actions depending on the accessed url. In order to enable client side rendering <b>Path.JS</b> library is used. The <b>attribute binding of knockout</b> is used to render the correct anchor tag.</p>
	<pre>
		<div class="well sidebar-nav" data-bind="with:selectedAsset">
			<ul class="nav nav-list">
				<li class="nav-header" data-bind="text:name"></li>
				<li><a data-bind="attr: {href: '#/' + name() + '/overview'}"><i class="icon-pencil"></i>Overview</a></li>
				<li><a data-bind="attr: {href: '#/' + name() + '/charges'}"><i class="icon-arrow-down"></i>Charges</a></li>
				<li><a data-bind="attr: {href: '#/' + name() + '/rents'}"><i class="icon-arrow-up"></i>Rents</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</pre>
	<p>You can also notice, that the <b>with binding</b> was used to set the current asset view model as the parent for the navigation div.</p>
	<p>The right part simply contains all of the 3 tabs (overview, charges or rents), only one of them visible at time. In order to separate the content into multiple files, partial rendering of ASP.MVC is used.<p>
	<pre>
		&lt;div id="assetDetail" class="span10" data-bind="template: {data: selectedAsset, if:selectedAsset, afterRender: detailsRendered}"&gt;
			&lt;div class="span10"&gt;
				&lt;div id="overview"&gt;
					@Html.Partial("Overview")
				&lt;/div&gt;
				&lt;div id="charges"&gt;
					@Html.Partial("Charges")
				&lt;/div&gt;
				&lt;div id="rents"&gt;
					@Html.Partial("Rents")
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	</pre>
	<p>Again the <b>with binding</p> is used as the selected appartment's ViewModel is used to back-up this part of the view.</p>
	<p>Now let's go back to the ViewModels. <b>ChargeViewModel</b> and <b>RentViewModel</b> have a same ancestor which is called <b>ObligationViewModel</b>. Since both rents and charges how some common properties such as the amount or the regularity, a common parent ViewModel is good place to define them.</p>
	<p>The most interesting part of <i>ChargeViewModel</i> is the <i>save</i> function which uses JQuery to emit a HTTP request to the <i>ChargesController</i>. As previously described, two different operations are exposed with the same url, one for creation (HTTP PUT) another for update (HTTP POST). The ViewModel uses a <i>new</i> flag to distinguish these two cases. Before the request is executed, the ViewModel uses <a href="https://github.com/ericmbarnard/Knockout-Validation">Knockout.Validation</a> plugin to perform this check with the<i>errors</i> property.</p>
	<pre>
	self.save = function () {
        if (self.errors().length != 0) {
            self.errors().showAllMessages();
            return;
        }

        self.isBusy(true);
        data = self.toDto();
        var rUrl = "/../api/charges?assetID=" + self.parent.id();
        if (self.isNew())
            var opType = "post";
        else
            var opType = "put";

        $.ajax(rUrl, {
            data: JSON.stringify(data),
            type: opType, contentType: "application/json",
            success: function (result) {
                self.isBusy(false);
                self.message(result.message);
                if (self.isNew()) {
                    self.update(result.dto);
                    parent.charges.push(self);
                }
            }
        });
    }
	</pre>
